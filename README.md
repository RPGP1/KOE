## In this game,
You use only the mouse.
The left button makes a bigger and slower wave.
The right one makes a smaller and quicker wave.
Two waves raise two characters in the center of the window.

## To win,
Avoid the objects which have only THIS COLOR.
Touch the ones which have “+”.
And in the end, when you touch the card ‘CLEAR’. You win this game!

### I used 'Transition.rb', one of the samples attached DXRuby.
